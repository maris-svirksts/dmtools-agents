User request is in the 'input' folder. Read all files there.

**IMPORTANT**: Before writing any test, read and follow these inputs in order:
1. `request.md` — the Test Case ticket: objective, preconditions, steps, expected result, and priority.
2. `comments.md` *(if present)* — ticket comment history; recent comments may contain prior test run results, failure analysis, or reviewer feedback.
3. Any other files present in the input folder for additional context.

The feature code is **already implemented** in the `main` branch and **deployed**. Your job is to automate this test case — not to implement features.

## Your task

1. Analyze the Test Case: understand what needs to be verified, what type it is (web, mobile, API), and which framework fits best.
2. Check `testing/` for existing components (pages, screens, services) and core utilities you can reuse.
3. **Check if test already exists** in `testing/tests/{TICKET-KEY}/`. If it does, reuse and update it rather than rewriting from scratch. Only modify what is necessary.
4. Write the automated test in `testing/tests/{TICKET-KEY}/` following the architecture rules in `agents/instructions/test_automation/test_automation_architecture.md`.
5. **Run the test** and capture the result.
6. Write output files.

**You may ONLY write code inside the `testing/` folder.**

## Output files

**⚠️ CRITICAL: All output files MUST be written to `outputs/` at the repository root** (e.g. `/home/runner/work/repo/repo/outputs/`).
Do NOT write them inside `input/`, `input/TICKET-KEY/`, or any subfolder of `input/`. The post-processing script reads from `outputs/` at the repo root — writing elsewhere means all results will be silently lost.

Run `mkdir -p outputs` first to ensure the directory exists.

- `outputs/response.md` — test result summary in **Jira Markdown** (posted as Jira ticket comment)
- `outputs/pr_body.md` — test result summary in **GitHub Markdown** (used as PR description)
- `outputs/test_automation_result.json` — structured result JSON (see instructions for exact format)
- `outputs/bug_description.md` — detailed bug report in Jira Markdown (only if test FAILED)

`response.md` and `pr_body.md` contain the same information but formatted differently — Jira MD vs GitHub MD.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: When the test FAILS — write a detailed bug report

If the test fails, `outputs/bug_description.md` **must** contain enough detail for a developer to reproduce and fix the bug without running the test themselves. Generic descriptions like "the test failed" or "element not found" are NOT acceptable.

**Required in `bug_description.md`:**

1. **Exact steps to reproduce** — copy the test steps from `request.md` and annotate each one with what actually happened:
   - Which step passed ✅
   - Which step failed ❌ and with what error/behaviour
   - What was on screen / in the response at the point of failure

2. **Exact error message or assertion failure** — paste the full stack trace or assertion output from the test runner, not a summary.

3. **Actual vs Expected** — be specific:
   - ❌ Bad: "the page did not load"
   - ✅ Good: "navigating to `/v/0097a85a-a616-4708-9dbd-8c2d81d47c38/` returned HTTP 404 and rendered the home page layout instead of the video watch page"

4. **Environment details** — URL, browser, OS, any relevant config values used during the run.

5. **Screenshots or logs** — if Playwright, attach screenshot path; paste relevant log lines.

The same level of detail applies to `response.md` — the Jira comment must clearly state **which step failed and why**, not just "FAILED".

Do NOT create branches or push. Do NOT modify any code outside `testing/`.
