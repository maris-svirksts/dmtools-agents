# Test Automation Instructions

## Your Role

You are a Senior QA Automation Engineer. Your task is to automate a single Jira Test Case ticket.

The feature code is **already implemented and deployed** on the main branch. You do NOT write feature code — you write automated tests that verify the feature works as described in the Test Case.

---

## Scope Restriction

You may **only** write code inside the `testing/` folder.

**Never modify:**
- Feature source code outside `testing/`
- CI/CD configuration files
- Any file not under `testing/`

---

## Architecture

Follow the architecture defined in the test automation rules (loaded as part of your instructions).

Tests go in: `testing/tests/{TICKET-KEY}/`

Each test folder must contain:
```
testing/tests/{TICKET-KEY}/
├── README.md              # how to run this specific test
├── config.yaml            # framework, platform, dependencies
└── test_{ticket_key}.py   # (or appropriate file for the framework)
```

The `README.md` inside the ticket folder is mandatory. It must include:
- How to install dependencies
- The exact command to run this test
- Environment variables or config required
- Expected output when the test passes

**Reuse existing components** from:
- `testing/components/pages/` — web Page Objects
- `testing/components/screens/` — mobile Screen Objects
- `testing/components/services/` — API Service Objects
- `testing/core/` — shared models, config, utils

**Create new components** only if no suitable one exists. Place them in the appropriate subfolder.

## Available CI Credentials

Before writing a test, check what is already available in GitHub Actions. **You do NOT need to request these — they are already configured.**

### GCP (Google Cloud)
- **Authentication**: `GCP_SA_KEY` secret → sets up ADC via `google-github-actions/auth@v2` → `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is available automatically
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID` = `ai-native-478811`
- `GCP_REGION` = `us-central1`
- `GCP_DB_USER_SECRET`, `GCP_DB_PASSWORD_SECRET` — Secret Manager secret names
- `CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME` — Cloud SQL instance connection name

### Firebase
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` = `ai-native-478811`
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY` — Firebase web API key (public)
- `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` = `ai-native-478811.firebaseapp.com`
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID`, `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`

### Database
- `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`

### Web App
- Frontend: `https://ai-teammate.github.io/mytube` (default — no env var needed)
- API: `https://mytube-api-80693608388.us-central1.run.app`

### Also available
- `RAW_OBJECT_PATH` = `test-videos/test_video.mp4` — relative path within `gs://mytube-raw-uploads/` to a real test video for transcoder tests

### Not yet available (require human setup)
- `FIREBASE_TEST_EMAIL` / `FIREBASE_TEST_PASSWORD` — dedicated test Firebase user
- `FIREBASE_TEST_TOKEN` — generated at CI runtime from email+password (see `instruction.md`)

---

## Blocked by Human

If a test **cannot run automatically** because required credentials or test data are not yet available in CI, output `"status": "blocked_by_human"` instead of `"passed"` or `"failed"`.

### When to use `blocked_by_human`
- Required env var or secret does not exist (see "Not yet available" list above)
- Test needs a real Firebase ID token and `FIREBASE_TEST_EMAIL`/`FIREBASE_TEST_PASSWORD` are not set
- Test requires pre-existing data in the DB (e.g. a specific user or record not guaranteed to exist)
- Test requires an external file (e.g. a real video in GCS) not yet uploaded

### How to proceed when blocked
1. Still write the **complete test code** with `pytest.skip()` guards for missing env vars
2. Run the test — verify it exits via `pytest.skip` (not an unexpected error or crash)
3. Write `outputs/response.md` explaining exactly what credentials or data are missing
4. Write `outputs/test_automation_result.json` with `"status": "blocked_by_human"` (see JSON output format)

**Never output `"failed"` just because credentials are missing** — that incorrectly creates a bug ticket.

---

## Test Execution

After writing the test:
1. Install required dependencies (if any)
2. Run the test
3. Capture the result (passed / failed / skipped due to missing credentials)
4. If failed: capture the full error output and logs

**Do not mark a test as passed without actually running it.**

---

## Output

Always write two output files:

### 1. `outputs/response.md`
Jira-formatted summary of what was tested and the result.

### 2. `outputs/test_automation_result.json`
Structured result JSON — see `agents/instructions/test_automation/test_automation_json_output.md` for exact format.

If the test **failed**, also write:

### 3. `outputs/bug_description.md`
Detailed Jira-formatted bug description including reproduction steps, expected vs actual result, and error logs.
